Reparse a [HAST][] tree, with support for embedded `raw`
nodes.  Keeping positional info OK.  üôå

## Installation

[npm][]:

```bash
npm install rehype-raw
```

## API

### `rehype().use(raw)`

Parse the tree again, also parsing ‚Äúraw‚Äù nodes (as exposed by remark).

## Usage

Say we have the following markdown file, `example.md`:

```markdown
A mix of *markdown* and <em>HTML</em>.
```

And our script, `example.js`, looks as follows:

```javascript
var vfile = require('to-vfile')
var report = require('vfile-reporter')
var unified = require('unified')
var markdown = require('remark-parse')
var remark2rehype = require('remark-rehype')
var doc = require('rehype-document')
var format = require('rehype-format')
var stringify = require('rehype-stringify')
var raw = require('rehype-raw')

unified()
  .use(markdown)
  .use(remark2rehype, {allowDangerousHTML: true})
  .use(raw)
  .use(doc, {title: 'üôå'})
  .use(format)
  .use(stringify)
  .process(vfile.readSync('example.md'), function(err, file) {
    console.error(report(err || file))
    console.log(String(file))
  })
```

Now, running `node example` yields:

```html
example.md: no issues found
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>üôå</title>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>A mix of <em>markdown</em> and <em>HTML</em>.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

#### Caution

_Commonmark treats any group of lines in raw HTML between a start and end
condition as an [HTML Block](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.29/#html-blocks)._

In accordance with these rules for, the remark parser will only process
markdown embedded between inline html tags and in its own paragraph.

Consider the following three examples:

*   In _example-1_, the entire block is treated as HTML.  Consequently,
    `*markdown*` remains unprocessed!

    Markdown:

    ```markdown
    <div class="example-1">
      A mix of *markdown* and <em>HTML</em>.
    </div>
    ```

    HTML:

    ```html
    <div class="example-1">
      A mix of *markdown* and <em>HTML</em>.
    <div>
    ```


*   In _example-2_, the content is treated as two HTML blocks with a markdown
    paragraph embedded between them.

    Markdown:

    ```markdown
    <div class="example-2">

      A mix of *markdown* and <em>HTML</em>.

    </div>
    ```

    HTML:

    ```html
    <div class="example-2">
      <p>A mix of <em>markdown</em> and <em>HTML</em>.</p>
    <div>
    ```

*   In _example-3_ the content is treated as a markdown paragraph with inline
    HTML.

    Markdown:

    ```markdown
    <span class="example-3">A mix of *markdown* and <em>HTML</em>.</span>
    ```

    HTML:

    ```html
    <p><span class="example-3">A mix of <em>markdown</em> and <em>HTML</em>.</span></p>
    ```
